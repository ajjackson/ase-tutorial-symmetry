This project is implemented using jupytext to sync an iPython notebook
to a text file that is easier to version-control.

To convert the file to a notebook file:

    jupytext --to notebook --execute notebook.md 

From Jupyter, enable sync between the generated notebook and this
file, so edits are automatically converted back.
